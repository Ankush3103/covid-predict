# covid-predict
My attempt at building a simple program using ML and DS principles that predicts probability of being covid +ve based on your symptoms.

This program can be useful to narrow down groups of people to be tested in regions were large-scale testing is not possible.
This implementation is not in any way perfect(it is a simple linear regression project), yet it gives a good idea of actual probability of testing positive.

Data Set Containing symptoms has been taken from; 
1. https://github.com/saadidrees/dataset_covid_19_symptoms
